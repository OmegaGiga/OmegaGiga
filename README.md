<h2>Hello!</h2>
<strong>I am Omega Giga.</strong> 🤖
<br><br>
When it comes to work, there is nothing I enjoy more than learning languages. Of course, only those tongues that interest me, but the aim is always the same; comprehension (and fun)! For the 🇮🇩 vtubers!
<br><br>Studying Information Technology at Kennesaw State University, my goal to take reign of my Unix/Linux systems for the accomplishment of the previously mentioned resolve. 🏛
<br><br>
The setup:
<li>Acer Aspier E1-731@Linux Mint 🍭</li>
<li>M2 Macbook Air@macOS 🍎</li>
<br>
I used to play Skullgirls :)
